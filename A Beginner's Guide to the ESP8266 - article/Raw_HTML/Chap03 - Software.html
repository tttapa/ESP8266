   <h3>Installation of the required software</h3>
   <div>
        The first step is to download and install the Arduino IDE. I explained this in <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/A-Beginners-Guide-to-Arduino/step3/Software/">A Beginner's Guide to Arduino</a>. (As of February 7th 2017, the latest stable version of the IDE is 1.8.1.)

        To program the ESP8266, you'll need a plugin for the Arduino IDE, it can be downloaded from <a href="https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino">GitHub</a> manually, but it is easier to just add the URL in the Arduino IDE:
   </div>
   <div>
       <ol>
           <li>Open the Arduino IDE.</li>
           <li>Go to File &gt; Preferences.</li>
           <li>Paste the URL <a href="http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json">http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json</a>&nbsp;into the <i>Additional Board Manager URLs </i>field.<br>
            (You can add multiple URLs, separating them with commas.)</li>
           <li>Go to Tools &gt; Board &gt; Board Manager and search for 'esp8266'. Select the newest version, and click install. (As of February 7th 2017, the latest stable version is 2.3.0.)</li>
       </ol>
       <div>
            You can check out the official install guide <a href="https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino/blob/master/doc/installing.md">here</a>.

       <h4>Drivers</h4>
       <div>
            If you are using a board with the CH340(G) USB-to-Serial chip, like the NodeMCU, you'll probably have to install the USB drivers for it.
       </div>
       <div>
            They can be found on <a href="https://github.com/nodemcu/nodemcu-devkit/tree/master/Drivers">GitHub</a>.&nbsp;
       </div>
       <div>
            If you are using a board with the CP2104 USB-to-Serial chip, like the Adafruit Feather HUZZAH board, you'll probably have to install USB drivers as well. You can find them on the <a href="http://www.silabs.com/products/mcu/pages/usbtouartbridgevcpdrivers.aspx">Silicon Labs website</a>.
       </div>
       <div>
            Boards with an FTDI chip should work right out of the box, without the need of installing any drivers.
